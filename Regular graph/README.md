Undirected graph is called regular, if all its vertices have the same degree.

Graph is given by list of edges. Check, is it regular.

Input data
First line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) of vertices and number m (m ≤ n (n - 1) / 2) of edges in a graph. Then given m pairs of numbers - the edges of graph.

Output data
Print YES if graph is regular and NO otherwise.
